## Project Description
A unity project done as a take-home assignment, which was done with no prior professional unity experience, just college and hackathon skills. Had to re-learn a lot of concepts as well as new ones.
The goal was to make a [Hole.IO](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.voodoo.holeio&pli=1) clone done in 1 week. As such the polish for the game is really rough as well as the project structure as I had to work through a limited amount of time to have an MVP.
The art for the logo and buttons were made using AI and the assets used came from the asset store.
