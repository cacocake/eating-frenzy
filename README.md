This project was a [Hole.IO](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.voodoo.holeio&pli=1) clone done in 1 week as a challenge to apply for a job. 
As such the polish for the game is really rough as well as the project structure as I had to work through a limited amount of time to have an MVP.
The art for the logo and buttons were made using AI and the assets used came from the asset store.
