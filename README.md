# Eating Frenzy

This was a project done in 1 week as a challenge to apply for a gaming company. As such the polish for the game is really rough as well as the project structure as I had to work through a limited amount of time to have an MVP.
The art for the logo and buttons were made using AI and the assets used came from the asset store.
